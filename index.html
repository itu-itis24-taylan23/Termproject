            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="bio">
                I am Sude, I born in Aksaray, I completed my primary, secondary and high school education in Aksaray. Now, I am first-year computer science student at İstanbul Technical University.The reason I chose engineering was that I was interested in numerical courses, especially physics. My academic journey has equipped me with skills such as time management, stress management, and the ability to learn complex topics effectively. Alongside my studies at ITU, I am also part of the different learning environment at 42 İstanbul.Outside of academics, I enjoy playing water polo,traveling and discovering new places.

                <h3>Academic Interests</h3>
                <p>I am intrigued in robotics, I worked in this field for a while in the ITU Rake team. Additionally, in 42 Istanbul, I worked on my own library, a printf-like function, and a function that reads a line each time it is called, and I am still improving myself in C programming by working on other collaborative projects.</p>
